## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- JS
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I used this project to learn how to create frontend elements that interact with JS in a practical way, and made a few leaps forward in:

 - Best Practice for creating a JS widget skeleton in HTML
 - CSS
 - How to implement keyboard navigation, including the existence of TabIndex which allows elements to be ignored, included, or conditionally ignored by navigating the site using 'Tab'
 - better understanding of media breakpoints, and 'mobile first' design
 - Much better understanding of using and manipulating svg files within the DOM
 - Hover animations

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
